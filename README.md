# NBA_Predictive_Model
This is a model that predicts how well an NBA player will perform in future games based on their 2018 to 2019 NBA stats through linear regression. The versatility index of a player is a metric used to measure a player's gameplay ability by considering their points per game, rebounds per game, and assists per game. This would be a good indicator of the general level of advantage that one player has over another. By analyzing the correlations between the versatility index and other variables, I have fine tuned a model to predict the versatility index of each player for future games.
